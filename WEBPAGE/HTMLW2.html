    title: A night in Mos Eisley
    scene: After 3 weeks in hyperspace, the crew of the Rocinate
    final caught some down time. While refuelling commences, the captain 
    heads to the famous Chalmuns Catina for a game of Corellian dice.
    The tables are in full uproar. A large Devian on a hot streak looses
    his entire stack of creds. Security removes him by way of blasters 
    and a seat becomes available."Lets hope I have better luck than he did!"
    the captain boast to the service droid running the table.He rolls
    the dice and comes up with a double. "Not a bad way to start off the night"
    he says as he places a large stack of creds on the table....
